# Renata planning

* Based on Erica's repository, run a similar LDA and changepoint analysis on the exclosure plots.
* Load data using portalr package
  * For this, need to deviate from rodent_data_for_LDA script

## What the exisitng data does and how to change it...
### rodent_data_for_LDA.R
Notably - looks at how many across *all* plots. so it's not 8 samples per period, it's each period is a sample.

returns a matrix of all the species (columns) and the counts per trapping session. adjusted to extrapolate as if all plots were trapped, for trap sessions when not all the plots were trapped. (/n plots actually trapped, * 8)

I'm having a hard time using the portalr package to extract exactly the same dataset as Erica did.
The discrepancy is in knowing a) which plots had which treatments at which trap sessions and b) which plots were trapped at each plot session.

Moving forward, I'm going to pull *longterm exclosure plots data* and then see if I can figure out which plots those are and how many of them were trapped per session.


## Objectives for 9/6/17
* Can you use abundance() to produce the same dataset as erica?
* is there an intuitive way to link treatment:period:plot? (month/year links)
I can get the same thing as Erica using components of portalr if I subset to Erica's plots.

I don't know how to reproduce the set of plots that she usedd - it isn't long-term control plots, which was my guess.
But yeah, if I specify that list of plots, I get the same table.

Moving forward, I am making a function to return an adjusted table given arguments:
period_first
period_last
treatment
time
This function is adjusted_abundance.
